Osgood is a fake SMTP server.  Its intended purpose is to
provide developers with a safe way to test email integration
without actually delivering emails.  This helps avoid
the developer having to sit in a room with a dozen
executives and explain why he inadvertantly sent a bunch
of meaningless or offensive test emails to customers.

The name "Osgood" is taken from America's first Postmaster
General.  I assume that he did a better job of actually
delivering mail than the osgood server does.
